**Note:** This proof of concept uses the sepolia testnet. I highly recommend using a faucet to get test funds. Check out [Google&#39;s Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia)

## Configuration

Configure your .env file in the root directory to have the following:

```
PRIVATE_KEY="<Private key of sepolia wallet>"
```

## Running

First install dependencies by running

```
$ yarn install
```

in the root directory.

Then run

```
$ yarn run
```

To run the test script!
