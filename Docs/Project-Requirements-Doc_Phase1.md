## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for a modular TypeScript package designed to facilitate rapid experimentation with the [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://docs.attest.org/docs/welcome) SDK. The package aims to provide developers with flexible, composable functions for interacting with EAS, allowing for quick prototyping and testing of attestation workflows. The intended environment is a VSCode workspace, with support for Copilot Agent mode to enable AI-assisted development and automation[7][10].

---

## General Description

- **Purpose:**  
  Provide a developer-friendly, modular toolkit for interacting with EAS, enabling easy creation, referencing, and management of attestations and schemas, both on-chain and off-chain.

- **Scope:**  
  - TypeScript package, managed with `yarn`
  - Designed for EVM-compatible testnets (e.g., Sepolia)
  - Focus on developer experience and composability

- **Stakeholders:**  
  - Primary: Developers exploring EAS capabilities
  - Secondary: Project maintainers, open-source contributors

- **Technical Dependencies:**  
  - Node.js and TypeScript
  - `@ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk`[6]
  - Ethers.js or similar for wallet and provider management
  - Yarn for dependency management

- **Constraints:**  
  - Requires user wallet address with test ether
  - Requires RPC API key for blockchain access

## Assumptions

- Users have a funded wallet address and access to a testnet (e.g., Sepolia)[9].
- Users possess an RPC API key for the relevant network.
- Users have basic familiarity with TypeScript, Node.js, and blockchain concepts.

---

## Example Use Cases

- Create a new schema, then make an attestation against it.
- Reference an existing attestation and update or revoke it.
- Store an attestation off-chain and retrieve it later.
- Combine multiple functions in a script to demonstrate a typical attestation workflow.

## User Stories Table

| User Story ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome | Referenced Requirements |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| US001 | Create a new attestation | As a user, I want to create a new attestation so that I can record a verifiable claim on the blockchain. | The system allows the user to input attestation data, signs and submits it, and returns the attestation ID. | FR1, FR5, FR7, FR8, NFR1, NFR2 |
| US002 | Reference existing attestation | As a user, I want to reference an existing attestation so that I can build upon or verify previous claims. | The system retrieves and displays attestation details given an attestation ID. | FR2, FR5, FR7, FR8, NFR1, NFR2 |
| US003 | Create a new schema | As a user, I want to create a new schema so that I can define the structure for future attestations. | The system allows the user to define schema fields and deploys the schema to the blockchain, returning its ID. | FR3, FR5, FR7, FR8, NFR1, NFR2 |
| US004 | Modify an existing schema | As a user, I want to modify an existing schema so that I can update data structures as my requirements change. | The system enables schema updates and propagates changes, ensuring backward compatibility where possible. | FR3, FR5, FR7, FR8, NFR1, NFR2 |
| US005 | Store attestation off-chain | As a user, I want to store an attestation off-chain so that I can save costs and preserve privacy. | The system saves the attestation data in a secure off-chain storage and provides a reference or proof. | FR4, FR5, FR8, NFR1, NFR2 |
| US006 | Retrieve off-chain attestation | As a user, I want to retrieve an off-chain attestation so that I can verify or use its data. | The system fetches the off-chain attestation using a reference and displays its contents. | FR4, FR5, FR8, NFR1, NFR2 |
| US007 | Compose workflows using multiple functions | As a user, I want to compose workflows using multiple functions so that I can automate complex EAS tasks. | The system allows chaining of modular functions, enabling users to script multi-step attestation processes. | FR5, FR6, FR8, NFR1, NFR2 |
| US008 | Handle errors and provide feedback | As a user, I want clear error messages and feedback so that I can quickly resolve issues during operations. | The system displays descriptive errors for failed actions and suggests possible resolutions. | FR7, FR8, NFR1, NFR2 |
| US009 | Use example scripts for onboarding | As a user, I want example scripts so that I can quickly learn how to use the packageâ€™s core features. | The system provides ready-to-run scripts demonstrating typical use cases with documentation. | FR6, FR8, NFR1, NFR2 |
| US010 | Integrate with Copilot Agent mode | As a user, I want the package to be compatible with Copilot Agent mode so that I can leverage AI assistance. | The system ensures documentation and code structure are optimized for Copilot Agent context extraction. | NFR4, NFR1, NFR2 |

## Quality and Testing

- Each function must include unit tests covering expected and edge-case behaviors.
- Example scripts should be provided and verified to work on at least one EVM testnet.
- Error messages must be descriptive and actionable.

---

## Additional Notes

- Place this document in the project root or `/docs` folder to maximize Copilot Agent mode context[7][10].
- Future enhancements may include UI components or integration with other EAS ecosystem tools.

---

## Glossary

- **Attestation:** A verifiable statement or claim recorded on-chain or off-chain via EAS.
- **Schema:** A template defining the data structure for attestations.
- **Composable Function:** A function designed to be combined with others to form complex workflows with minimal dependencies.
