# React + TypeScript + Vite

## Getting started

Within the root directory of the react project "qr-poc". Create a `.env` file and fill it with the details found in `.env.example`

```
VITE_PRIVATE_KEY="" # Your sepolia wallet private key (keep this to yourself!)
VITE_INFURA_API_KEY="" # Your Infura Sepolia API key
```

Then, run `npm install` to install packages.

### Starting the development server

To run the development server locally, run `npm run dev`. This will output an address to navigate to in a browser.

#### Browser requirements

1. Use a recent (if not latest) version of chrome.
2. Ensure Metamask is installed and a wallet with Sepolia ETH is selected
